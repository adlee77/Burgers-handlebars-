# A Burger App!

This is a fun app I created to practice my MVC architecture as well as my SQL knowledge. This app allows users to write in a type of burger they would like to eat and save it to a SQL database.

# What does the app do?
* Users can write in a type of burger they wish to consume.
* The burger is moved to an uneaten column, where users can decide to "eat it!"
* If eaten, the burger is moved to an eaten column, where users can decide to remove it.

# Technologies Utitilzed
* MySQL, Handlebars, Bootstrap

# Styling
I thought a cartoonish style would be more user friendly and would look better for the app. Therefore, I decided to use a cartoon burger image, blockish fonts, and eye-popping buttons. I used bootstrap's grid system to make things even and symmetrical.
